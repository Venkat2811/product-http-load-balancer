# HTTP Load Balancer On Top Of WSO2 Gateway
This is a Google Summer of Code (GSoC 2016) Project.  It is under development.

Performance Benchmarks
----------------------
In this performance test, five instances of simple service created using Netty framework were used.  Each instance is a fast backend (0s delay) with response of size 1KB.

**One Million (1,000,000) requests** were sent at different **concurrency levels (500 to 12,000)** to Netty backend, Nginx and GW-LB using apache bench via this [automated script] (performance-benchmark/excecute-tests.sh).

Benchmarks were conducted in Round-Robin algorithm mode with no persistence policies.  More details can be found [here](performance-benchmark).

<br/>
<b>Throughput Test</b>

Tests were done twice.  Average of 'Average throughput' for each concurrency level is calculated and plotted.  

First graph shows throughput comparison between Open Source Nginx and GW-LB.  Second graph shows throughput comparison with Netty backend.

<br/>
<b>Latency Test</b>

Tests were done twice.  Average of 'Mean Latency' for each concurrency level is calculated and plotted.

<br/>
<b>Memory Test</b>

**Java Flight Recorder (JFR)** is enabled while starting LB server and recording is stopped after load test ends.  The obtained JFR recording has memory usage details.

This graph shows **Committed, Reserved and Used Heap** values.

#### Enabling JFR in WSO2-Carbon Server

```
cd CARBON_HOME/bin

Open carbon.sh in any text editor
```

Then add the following lines in between "-Dfile.encoding=UTF8 \" and "org.wso2.carbon.bootstrap.Bootstrap $*"

```
-XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures \
-XX:+FlightRecorder \
-XX:FlightRecorderOptions=defaultrecording=true,disk=true,maxage=0,repository=./tmp,dumponexit=true,dumponexitpath=./ \
```

Building Product
----------------

- Clone and do `mvn install` on https://github.com/wso2/carbon-gateway-framework.git as this product
  is dependent on it.

- Then do `mvn install` on this product.

- Now Clone and do `mvn install` on https://github.com/Venkat2811/carbon-gateway-framework-with-LB.git as it 
  has support for LB.

- Again do `mvn install` on this product.

- Goto `<CARBON_HOME>\product-http-load-balancer\product\target\` and 
  extract `wso2gwlbserver-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip`.

- Then goto `<CARBON_HOME>\product-http-load-balancer\product\target\wso2gwlbserver-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\wso2gwlbserver-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\bin` and start `carbon.bat` or `carbon.sh` accordingly. 


Sample Configuration
--------------------

```
@startuml

participant StocksInbound : InboundEndpoint(protocol("http"),port("8290"),context("/stocks"))

participant StocksPipeline : Pipeline("Stocks_Flow")

participant Endpoint1 : OutboundEndpoint(protocol("http"),host("http://localhost:8080/stockquote/all"))

participant Endpoint2 : OutboundEndpoint(protocol("http"),host("http://localhost:8082/stockquote/all"))

participant Endpoint3 : OutboundEndpoint(protocol("http"),host("http://localhost:8084/stockquote/all"))

participant Endpoint4 : OutboundEndpoint(protocol("http"),host("http://localhost:8086/stockquote/all"))

participant Endpoint5 : OutboundEndpoint(protocol("http"),host("http://localhost:8088/stockquote/all"))

StocksInbound -> StocksPipeline : "client request"

LoadBalancer(algorithm(name(ROUND_ROBIN)),persistence(type(NO_PERSISTENCE)),healthCheck(type(PASSIVE),requestTimeout(5s),unHealthyRetries(2times),healthyRetries(3times),healthyCheckInterval(1m)))

StocksPipeline -> StocksInbound : "Final Response"

Traffic Flows
-------------

Carbon Gateway Framework provides abstraction on HTTP/HTTPs traffic.  By configuring Inbound and Outbound endpoints with appropriate protocol the following three modes of operation can be achieved.

#### Simple HTTP
Traffic between `Client -> LB -> Back-End` and `Back-End -> LB -> Client` are un-encrypted.


#### SSL Offload
 - Traffic from `Client -> LB` and `LB -> Client` are encrypted.
 - Traffic from `LB -> Back-End` and `Back-End -> LB` are un-encrypted.
 
 In this mode, when request reaches WSO2-Netty Listener, it gets decrypted and LB mediates requests to appropriate Outbound Endpoints. 
 
 When response from back-end reaches LB, it forwards it to appropriate client.  When response reaches WSO2-Netty Listener it is encrypted and is forwarded to client.


#### SSL Re-Encryption
Traffic between `Client -> LB -> Back-End` and `Back-End -> LB -> Client` are encrypted.

 In this mode, when request reaches WSO2-Netty Listener, it gets decrypted and LB mediates requests to appropriate Outbound Endpoints.  When requests reach WSO2-Netty sender it gets encrypted again and is sent to backend.
 
 It works similarly when response arrives.
